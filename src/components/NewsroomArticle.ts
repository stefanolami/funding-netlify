                            Furthermore, a key element of cooperation will be to strengthen EU-India trade ties and to advise on political developments to this 
                            end, with a view of impacting relations between the two geographies at government, business and civil society levels. Time&Place is 
                            setting up a trade and business development division to fulfil these aims. </br></br>The division will be led by:

Once looking for partners, it was very easy for me to decide for Time&Place 
                        Consulting. The first time I encountered them was when Time&Place became Official Partner of the European Paralympics Committee following which they 
                        organised a high-level webinar on the future of the Paralympic Movement from the perspective of youth. After that, the more I looked into Time&Place, 
                        the more I saw synergies with our core beliefs and business ambitions.”
